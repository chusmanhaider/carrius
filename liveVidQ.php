                We have a one click video connect system where you will join a room automatically and it might
                take less than 5-10 minutes for an Agent to join in. However, if the dealership is busy you will have
                to wait patiently or if you prefer a video call back, please click on ‘Message Dealer’ And we will
                get back to you.

            <p class="changeColor leftMar">
                We give the choice of making a one-way or two-way video call with our software on first page
                itself. In a one-way call, the salesperson can be seen and heard by the customer, but the customer
                can only be heard, and not seen, by the salesperson. This will make consumers more comfortable
                initiating the video call with you until they are ready to move to the two-way video call, if they
                desire. In two ways, Customer and salesperson can see and hear each other.
