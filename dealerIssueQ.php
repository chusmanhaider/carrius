                We do not sell car. We are here to ensure a better communication service between a buyer and a
                dealer. Once you've found the car you want, talk with an agent online and the dealership will arrange
                the rest.

            <p class="changeColor leftMar">
                Depending on local area restrictions, some dealerships are offering Car Test Drive. This means
                you buy the car remotely and then can Test Drive the car outside of the dealership with a COVID
                secure handover - including sanitation of the car. This can be done after speaking with salesperson
                on a Live Video call or by chatting with them and fill in the contact sale form.
